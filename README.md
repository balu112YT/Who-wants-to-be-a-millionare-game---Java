How it works:

- You are asked a question about Java.
- Each question has 4 possible answers (A, B, C, D). Pick the one you think is correct.
- If your answer is correct, you win a prize. The prize money is in Hungarian Forints (HUF)
  - Starting prize: 10,000 HUF
  - Maximum prize: 50,000,000 HUF
- If your answer is incorrect, the game ends and you lose, but you keep any money you reached at the last checkpoint.

Lifelines (help options)

You have 3 lifelines, each can be used only once:

1. 50/50 – Removes two incorrect answers, leaving you with one wrong and the correct answer.
2. Audience – The audience suggests an answer (randomly generated in this version).
3. Phone a Friend – Your friend gives a suggested answer (randomly generated in this version).

Checkpoints

- Every 5th question (5th, 10th, 15th) is a checkpoint.
- If you answer correctly, your earnings at that checkpoint are guaranteed even if you lose later.
- At each checkpoint, you can decide to quit and take your guaranteed winnings or continue playing.

Goal

- If you answer all questions correctly, you win the maximum prize of 50,000,000 HUF.
